# mkconf
my machinekit configurations
You can find them in the various branches

I have 3 3d printers, a geeetech, a self built delta wich height is 60cm, and a bigger one controlled from a pc via parallel port.

configurations with "hal" means that they are based on standard hal file for configuration. another option is basing it on python scripts, that to date I still have to learn how to manage.

Consider this as my public backup database
